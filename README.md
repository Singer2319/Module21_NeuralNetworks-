## Module21_Neural_Networks
A report on the performance of the deep learning model you created for Alphabet Soup.

Overview of the analysis: the purpose of this analysis is to create a model that helps it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. That way, Alphabet Soup can focus funding on ventures that will prove successful.

Data Preprocessing

What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
What variable(s) are the features for your model?
What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.
